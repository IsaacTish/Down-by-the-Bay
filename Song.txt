# Down-by-the-Bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Did you ever see a goose
Kissing a moose?"
Down by the bay.
Have you ever seen a goat
Cruising on a boat
Down by the bay
Have you ever seen a fox
Put on some sox
Down by the bay
